# OddSU
## The Key-Based SU system.
### `Installation:`
run `git clone https://github.com/OddbyteWasTaken/oddsu.git` and move into the folder it creates.
run `bash install.sh` as root or a user with sudo access
make a SuperKey, and enjoy!

# IMPORTANT:
## OddSU IS IN ALPHA. THIS IS NOT THE FINAL PRODUCT. DO NOT SHARE THE SuperKey WITH ANYONE, AS THIS GRANTS FULL ACCESS TO YOUR SYSTEM!

This repo was inspired by APatch, the systemless root for android that I personally use.
### This is in ALPHA. Subject to change. Nothing is final. Please make a PR / GH Issue to suggest features. Do not share your SuperKey with any other user. I am not liable if you destroy your PC, start a thermonucular war, or if your alarm app stops working and you are late for work. This software is provided AS-IS. Do NOT attempt to use my code for-profit without getting written consent from me either on my github account (@OddbyteWasTaken), or on my discord, @oddbyte
