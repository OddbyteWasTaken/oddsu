# OddSU
## The Key-Based SU system.
### `Installation:`
run `git clone https://github.com/OddbyteWasTaken/oddsu.git` and move into the folder it creates.
run `bash install.sh` as root or a user with sudo access
make a SuperKey, and enjoy!

This repo was inspired by APatch, the systemless root for android that I use.

## Usage:
```
osu [-u <UID/USERNAME> Defaults to 0 aka root] [-c *EVERYTHING after -c will be in the command. Put this AFTER -u! Defaults to /bin/bash]
```

## IMPORTANT:
### This is in ALPHA. Subject to change. Nothing is final. Please make a PR / GH Issue to suggest features and/or report bugs. Do not share your SuperKey with any other user. I am not liable if you destroy your PC, start a thermonucular war, or if your alarm app stops working and you are late for work. This software is provided AS-IS. Do NOT attempt to use my code for-profit without getting written consent from me either on my github account (@OddbyteWasTaken), or on my discord, @oddbyte
